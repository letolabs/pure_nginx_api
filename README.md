# Pure Nginx API

Why waste time and memory spinning up dynamic language interpreters when you can respond in less than 200ms?

## Example JSON API implemented in "pure" Nginx (Openresty) and Postgres

This repository uses vagrant, to take it for a spin:

  vagrant up
  
After a few minutes, you should be able to go to

  http://openresty.virtual/api/v1/health
  
and get a valid JSON response
